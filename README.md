## About

Searr tries to bridge the gap between real life and online meetings. One of the main issues with online meetings is everyone having to listen to one speaker whereas in real life meetings multiple groups form to talk about different topics. Searr enables people in the same meet to form groups and you only listen and speak to people near you.
